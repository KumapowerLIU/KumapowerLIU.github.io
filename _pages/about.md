I am a third-year (final) Ph.D. student in the Department of Computer Science and Engineering at [HKUST](https://hkust.edu.hk/), where I am fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Qifeng Chen](https://cqf.io/).

Prior to joining HKUST, I spent two incredible years at Huya as a computer vision engineer, working under the guidance of [Dr. Xintong Han](https://xthan.github.io/) and [Dr. Jia Xu](https://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~jiaxu/). I also had the privilege of interning at Tencent AI Lab, where I was mentored by [Dr. Yibing Song](https://ybsong00.github.io/) and [Dr. Wei Liu](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=AjxoEpIAAAAJ&hl=zh-CN). During this time, I collaborated frequently with my close friend [Dr. Ziyu Wan](http://raywzy.com/).

My primary research interests lie in 2D/3D generation, digital humans, neural rendering, and contrastive learning. Currently, I am interning at Ant Research, where I am supervised by [Dr. Xuan Wang](https://xuanwangvc.github.io/), focusing on 3D generation.

Outside of academia, I am passionate about fishingâ€”itâ€™s more than a hobby; itâ€™s a dream of mine to fish across all of China!

ðŸ”¥ ***I am actively seeking global opportunities for academic exchange visits starting in Fall 2025. If you are interested or aware of any opportunities, please feel free to reach out to me via emailâ€”I would be delighted to connect!***
