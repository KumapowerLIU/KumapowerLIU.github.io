I am a third-year(final) Ph.D. student in the Department of Computer Science and Engineering at [HKUST](https://hkust.edu.hk/), where I am fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Qifeng Chen](https://cqf.io/). My primary research interests lie in 2D/3D generation, digital humans, neural rendering, and contrastive learning. Outside of academia, I am passionate about fishing—it’s more than a hobby; it’s a dream of mine to fish across all of China!
