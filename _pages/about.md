I am a third-year (final-year) Ph.D. student in the Department of Computer Science and Engineering at The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology [HKUST](https://hkust.edu.hk/), where I am fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Qifeng Chen](https://cqf.io/).
My research focuses on a range of topics in computer vision and graphics, including 2D/3D content generation, digital humans, neural rendering, and video generation. I am particularly interested in building intelligent systems that can understand and synthesize realistic visual content of human or avtar, bridging the gap between the physical and digital worlds.

Beyond research, I’m deeply passionate about fishing—not just as a hobby, but as a personal dream. I aspire to one day travel across China to fish in its diverse rivers, lakes, and coastal waters, using the journey as a way to connect with nature, explore local cultures, and find inspiration outside the lab.
